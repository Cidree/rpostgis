Title: R Interface to a 'PostGIS' Database
Description: Provides an interface between R and 'PostGIS'-enabled
    'PostgreSQL' databases to transparently transfer spatial
    data. Both vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster data are
    supported in read and write modes. Also provides convenience
    functions to execute common procedures in 'PostgreSQL/PostGIS'.
