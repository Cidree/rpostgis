rpostgis 1.1.0
==============

OVERALL CHANGES

* Added four example datasets (all have prefix `db_`).

NEW FUNCTIONS

* `pgWriteRast` to upload R Raster* datasets to PostGIS database
  tables.
  
* `dbWriteDataFrame`/`dbReadDataFrame`: Write/read in data frame mode
  to/from database table (see below).

NEW FEATURES

* `pgInsert` can write in data frame mode when `df.mode = TRUE`
  (default is `FALSE`).

* `pgInsert` now defaults to 'alter.names = FALSE'.

* `pgGetGeom` will try to read Spatial*DataFrames in data frame mode
  (will not affect import for non-data frame mode tables).
  
* `pgGetRast` now has a `band` argument to select which band in the
  database raster to import.

ABOUT DATA FRAME MODE

Writing in data frame mode is only for new database tables (or for
overwriting an existing one). It will save all column names as they
appear in R, along with column data types and attributes.  This is
done by adding metadata to a lookup table in the table's schema named
'.R_df_defs' (will be created if not present).  It also adds two fixed
names to the database table: '.R_rownames' (storing the `row.names` of
the data frame), and '.db_pkid', which is a new integer primary
key. Existing columns in the `data.frame` matching these names will be
automatically changed. For more flexible writing of Spatial*DataFrames
and `data.frames` to the database, users should run `pgInsert` with
`df.mode = FALSE`.


rpostgis 1.0.4
==============

BUG FIXES

NEW FEATURES

  UPDATE) with the 'upsert.using' argument. Requires PostgreSQL
