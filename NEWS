rpostgis 1.1.0
=============

***  NEW FUNCTIONS ***

* pgWriteRast to upload R Raster* datasets to PostGIS database tables
  
* dbWriteDataFrame for writing data.frames to PostgreSQL 
  in "data frame mode" (see below)
  
* dbReadDataFrame for re-reading data frames written to the 
  database in data frame mode

*** OTHER CHANGES ***

* added four example datasets (all have prefix "db_")

* pgInsert can write in data frame mode when df.mode = TRUE

* pgInsert 'alter.names' argument now defaults to FALSE

* pgGetGeom will try to read Spatial*DataFrames in data frame mode
  (will not affect import for non-data frame mode tables)
  
* pgGetRast now has a "band" argument to select which band in the database 
  raster to import

*** about data frame mode ***

Writing in data frame mode is only for new database tables (or for
overwriting an existing one). It will save all column names as they
appear in R, along with column data types and attributes. 
This is done by adding metadata to a lookup table in the table's
schema named ".R_df_defs" (will be created if not present). 
It also adds two fixed names to the database table: ".R_rownames" (storing
the row.names of the data frame), and ".db_pkid", which is a new
integer primary key. Existing columns in the data.frame matching these
names will be automatically changed. For more flexible writing of
Spatial*DataFrames and data.frames to the database, users should 
run pgInsert with df.mode = FALSE.
